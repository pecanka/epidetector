# EpiDetector

A tool for identifying epistasis (i.e., gene-to-gene interactions) in a genome-wide analysis setting. 
EpiDetector implements several flavors of a two-stage testing approach.

The underlying methodology is described in [this paper](https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxw060) and in [this book chapter](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-0716-0947-7_6).

Please report any bugs via this github page.
